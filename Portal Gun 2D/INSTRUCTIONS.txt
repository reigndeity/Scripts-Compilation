Assuming you downloaded the package I exported (you're welcome). you may wanna follow this shit for it to work:



	Make layers:
	3 = Ground
	6 = Portal
	7 = PickableObject
	8 = wallLayer


	Then, in your PlayerController script, disable Flip().
	

	Pickable object should have two box colliders with the other one having is trigger set to true.

	Pickable object should have the tag "Box" and layer "PickableObject".

	
	Blue portal should have the tag "BluePortal" and layer "Portal".
	Orange portal should have the tag "Orange" and layer "Portal".

	
	Walls should have the tag "Wall"
